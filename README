RELION (for REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN) is a stand-alone computer program for Maximum A Posteriori refinement of (multiple) 3D reconstructions or 2D class averages in cryo-electron microscopy. It is developed in the research group of Sjors Scheres at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. The underlying theory of MAP refinement is given in a scientific publication: Scheres, JMB (2011) (DOI: 10.1016/j.jmb.2011.11.010). If RELION is useful in your work, please cite this paper. 

The documentation of RELION is stored on the following Wiki page:

The INSTALL.sh script is provided for convenient installation. Please see the above-mentioned Wiki for more information.

THIS BRANCH IS DEDICATED TO DEVELOPING GPU SUPPORT FOR TRANSLATION PARAMETERS:

Current:
--------------------------
divide particles into sets
for set of particles
{
  for particle in set
  {
    for each orientation
    {
      P = Project Model M along orientation
      C = Apply CTF to P
      for each translation
      {
        S = construct fourier shift sorresponding to orientation
	J = apply S to image I
	D = diff between shifted image J and the current projection C
      }
    }
  }
}


New:
--------------------------
divide particles into sets
for set of particles
{
  for particle in set
  {
    for each orientation
    {
      P = Project Model M along orientation
      C = Apply CTF to P
      send the projection C, image I, and shifts to GPU
      |
      ----------->GPU:
 		  J = shift pixel in image I by shift
		  D = diff between pixel in J and pixel in the current projection C
		  |
      <------------
      }
    }
